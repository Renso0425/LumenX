            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">Hello everyone, my name is Darren Zheng. When I was in the late stages of middle school, 
            I often found myself alone a lot of times. I wasn’t interested in interacting with my peers. 
            I would also find myself experiencing constant hopelessness, sadness, and occasional suicidal 
            thoughts. I wasn’t sure if it was an actual case of depression. I wasn’t sure if I needed therapy 
            or if what I was feeling was normal. I reached out to a therapist in highschool, but I thought that 
            therapy was such a waste of time. Looking back from now, I am in such a better position yet now I’m 
            wondering in what ways I can help other people to know that their feelings are valid, and to educate 
            them on what depression is.</p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;font-size:20px">Right now, due to the covid pandemic, there is a rise in the number of 
            depression cases. Since majority of depression cases often results in suicide, action must be taken.
            I created this website in hopes of shedding more light on depression. But first, take a quiz about depression to see how much you actually know so far. And after
            navigating my website, take the quiz again to see if you learned anything new!
